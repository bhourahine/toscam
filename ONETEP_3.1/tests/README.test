 TEST 
 ----

 The test directory contains a number of input files and 
 corresponding reference output files for checking correct 
 operation of the ONETEP code.

------------------------------------------------------------

 To run, e.g., the eighth test calculation on, say, 2 
 processors, first compile ONETEP on your platform, as 
 described in the INSTALL file (in the root directory of 
 the distribution). Then,

  ~> cd test08
 
  ~> mpirun -np 2 ../../bin/onetep.arch h_bond > h_bond.out

 and compare the output to the output file provided in the 
 "reference" directory.

------------------------------------------------------------

 Please note that the two tests of Conduction NGWF optimisation
 (test19 and test20) will not be able to run until the relevant
 valence calculation has completed. This means test06 and test17
 must already have completed (and written their .dkn file and
 .tightbox_ngwfs file before the COND tests can run successfully.

 The directories test19 and test20 therefore include symbolic
 links to ../test06/ and ../test17/ so if your system is not
 set up in the standard way you may need to manually copy over
 these files or set up links yourself.
