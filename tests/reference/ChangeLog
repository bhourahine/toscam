Change Log for ONETEP Quality Control Test Results

ndmh_2009_12_18: Added QC test results for Core i7 Processors, using new
                 ewald_mod.F90. Results with old ewald_mod.F90 match old QC
                 results for other architectures. Results for other
                 architectures should be tested similarly for consistency and
                 then updated as appropriate.

jd_2010_02_03: - Deleted test results for SUN (obsolete).
               - Deleted test results for OPTERON (duplicated by HECTOR).
               - Updated all test results for CORE2 with the ones generated
                 by the current ONETEP version, to reflect the minor changes
                 due to a bugfix in ppd_strategy.
               - Added results for test 16: martyna_tuckerman.out to CORE2.

ndmh_2010_02_19: - Added species_ldos_groups block to ethene_props.dat to make
                   it test the LDOS functionality
                 - Updated ethene_relax.out in COREi7 reference output, for 
                   new geometry path, owing to changes in NGWF tightbox read 
                   routines changing energies and forces for read-in tightboxes.
                 - Updated ethene_props.out in COREi7 reference output, for LDOS
                   output
                 - Updated xyz-periodic_silanes.out in COREi7 reference output,
                   due to fix in ppd_strategy_mod for FFTbox sizes.
                 - Added COREi7 output for Martyna-Tuckerman test (test16)

jd_2010_02_26: - Updated ethene_relax.out, ethene_props.out and 
                 xyz-periodic_silanes.out in CORE2 reference output, for the
                 same reasons as above.
               - Updated all reference QC test results for HECTOR to reflect 
                 recent changes.

ndmh_2010_03_25: - Updated CORE2_4procs and COREi7_4procs versions of 
                   FeCO3_Ueq6_HUBBARDSCF.out and FeCO3_Ueq6.out because of fixes
                   to xc_mod in spin-polarised systems

jd_2010_05_05: - Added reference for test17 -- h2_noprojectors.out to test 
                 the case where no projectors are used.

ndmh_2010_05_06: - Swapped out h2-noprojectors, swapped in hchain.out (to test
                   bandstructure as well as just no projectors) in CORE2 
                   reference.

ndmh_2010_05_06: - Updated FeCO3_Ueq6_HUBBARDSCF and FeCO3_Ueq6 and C69N 
                   reference outputs in CORE2 and COREi7 due to new 
                   spin-polarised normalisation of kernel.

ndmh_2010_05_07: - Updated hchain.out in CORE2 and COREi7 reference outputs 
                   due to realisation that old versions were causing a problem
                   with inconsistent overlap matrices.

ndmh_2010_05_18: - Updated Si8_cell5p38ang_ngwfs.out in CORE2 and COREi7
                   reference outputs due to fix for bugs in FFTbox==cell code.

ndmh_2010_05_18: - Updated hchain.out due to change in sign convention for
                   unfolded k-points.

jd_2010_09_01: - Updated CORE2_4procs version of h_bond_class_DEVEL to reflect
                 the fact that classical atoms are now included in the Ewald
                 calculation. 
                 Corei7_4procs and HECTOR_4procs version still need updating.

cks_2010_09_27: - Updated CORE2_4procs version of h_bond_class_DEVEL to reflect
                  the fact that classical atoms are now represented as Gaussians.
                  Corei7_4procs and HECTOR_4procs version still need updating.

ndmh_2010_10_12: - Updated h_bond.out, h_bond_spd.out and 
                   xyz-periodic_silanes.out in CORE2 reference outputs due to
                   change in FFTbox specification.
                   Due to a highly unfavourable minimum FFTbox size (67x67x67 - 
                   ie all prime hence very slow), upped the energy cutoff of 
                   ethane_relax to 750 eV so that the cell is 77x77x77 and the 
                   FFTbox can be 75x75x75. Updated CORE2 reference to match new
                   input.

jd_2010_11_02: - Added QC-tests 21 and 22. Added reference outputs for these
                 for CORE2_4procs.

ndmh_2010_11_11: - Updated several out-of-date QC outputs in COREi7 directory.
                 - Added new results in COREi7 directory for tests 21 and 22.

ars_2010_11_23: - Added QC tests 26 and 27 plus references.

ars_2010_11_23: - Updated QC references CORE2_4procs (tests2,3,5,7,15), 
		  COREi7_4procs(tests2,3,5,7,8,10,11,14,15) and HECTOR_4procs
		  (tests[1-17]).

jd_2010_12_16: - Updated QC references CORE2_4procs (tests 21, 22) with v2.9.2.8
                 to account for minor differences in output and different slab
                 assignment. Added QC reference 23 for CORE2_4procs.

ars_2011_01_17: - Updated references CORE2_4procs (test07,15,26), 
                  COREi7_4procs(test07,11,15,26) and HECTOR_4procs(test15,26).
                  These changes come after the modification of electronic_lagrangian
                  for exact_lnv. Test11 had scaped from previous updates and has been
                  included in this update. Changed input file of test26 for newer
                  version of kernel_diis.

ndmh_2011_02_02: Updated QC reference COREi7 and CORE2 for tests 2 and 15 for
                 change to updating of matrices at end of loop ngwf_cg_mod

cks_2011_02_04:- Updated h_bond_class_DEVEL.out according to changes in electrostatic 
                 embedding functionality. Currently updated only for Core2 platform -
                 needs to be updated for remaining QC test platforms.
                 Added new QC test h_bond_class_CC.dat which tests electrostatic 
                 embedding within cutoff Coulomb.

ars_2011_02_15: Updated QC test27. Updated CORE2, COREi7 and HECTOR references
                for test26 and test27.

ndmh_2011_03_18: Updated h_bond_class_DEVEL.out in COREi7 directory consistent
                 with above change. Added h_bond_class_CC.out in COREi7
                 directory.

jd_2011_04_08: Updated reference for QC tests using the multigrid solver (21,22,23)
               for CORE2_4procs to account for the bugfix in the calculation of the
               residual, which is calculated correctly since v2.9.4.0. Energies were
               not affected to more than a 0.1 uHa/atom. References for remaining
               architectures remain to be updated.

ndmh_2011_05_03: Updated FeCO3_Ueq6.out and FeCO3_Ueq6_HUBBARDSCF.out in COREi7
                 directory to match changes to DFT+U forces in v2.9.5.0

jd_2011_05_20: Updated FeCO3_Ueq6.out and FeCO3_Ueq6_HUBBARDSCF.out in HECTOR and CORE2
               directory to match changes to DFT+U forces in v2.9.5.0
               
jd_2011_05_20: Added references for tests 18, 21, 22, 23 to HECTOR directory.

jd_2011_05_20: Updated reference for h_bond_class_DEVEL (cf. cks_2011_02_04) for
               HECTOR.

ndmh_2011_05_20: Updated, C69N.out, h_bond_class_CC.out, hchain.out, 
                 ethene_props.out, GaAs_dimer.out, h_bond_class_DEVEL.out
                 due to new <QC> flags in properties_mod. Added
                 h_bond_class_CC.out in COREi7_4procs

ndmh_2011_05_20: Updated, C69N.out, hchain.out, ethene_props.out, and
                 GaAs_dimer.out due to new <QC> flags in properties_mod,
                 in CORE2_4procs

jd_2011_06_10: Updated openbc_multigrid (QC #23) reference for CORE2_4procs to
               take into account the change in threshold for charge coarse-graining
               and the rescaling procedure. References for other architectures need
               updating.

jd_2011_06_20: Updated openbc_multigrid reference for CORE2_4procs again to take
               into account further minor changes in charge coarse-graining. References
               for other architectures need updating. Updated h_bond_B3LYP (QC #9)
               reference for CORE2_4procs to reflect the fix in the VWN functional.
               References for other architectures need updating.
               
jd_2011_06_21: Added a new test (npa.dat, QC #29) along with a reference for CORE2_4procs.
               References for other architectures need to be added.

jd_2011_06_28: Updated martyna_tuckerman reference for CORE2_4procs to take into account
               improvements to the accuracy of the Martyna-Tuckerman approach. References
               for other architectures need updating.

ndmh_2011_07_18: Updated martyna_tuckerman, h_bond_B3LYP, GaAs_dimer and
                 h_bond_class_CC references for HECTOR_4procs due to recent
                 changes.

ndmh_2011_09_21: Added tests test19 and test20 (ethene_cond and hchain_cond) to
                 test "task: COND" functionality (conduction NGWF optimisation).
                 Both rely on the results of valence calculations (test06 and test17)
                 respectively, so need to be run after those have completed. They
                 use symbolic links to the .dkn and .tightbox_ngwf calculations
                 respectively.

ndmh_2011_09_21: Updated h_bond_class_CC .dat for fact that cutoff coulomb lengths
                 are now esdf "physical" inputs, rather than being hardwired
                 to bohr.

ndmh_2011_09_21: Updated martyna_tuckerman.out in COREi7_4procs directory.

jd_2011_09_27: Updated QC test #29 (npa.dat) and corresponding reference for CORE2_4procs.
               References for other architectures need to be added/updated.
