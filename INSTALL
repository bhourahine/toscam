Instructions for installing TOSCAM

The following assumes that your working directory is the top level of the TOSCAM tree.

To install TOSCAM, complete the following steps. Where relevant, ensure that the makefiles point to
the correct HOME directory

   1) Compile the libraries in genlib. This involves...
      a) in genlib/LIB_DIERICK/ "make build"
      b) in genlib/LIBSLATEC/static "make libslatec.a" and then "mv libslatec.a .."
      c) in genlib/LIB_FIELD_SPLINE/src/ "make build" and then "mv libfield.a .."
      d) in genlib/LIB_GPU_NUMERICS/ "make build"
      e) in genlib/LIBUTILS/ "make build"
   2) Compile any solvers (e.g. in ed_solver, run "make build")
   3) Compile the dmft wrappers executables in dmft/ via "make prog", making sure the makefile is
      directed towards the installed libraries and solvers
